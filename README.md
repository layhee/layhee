# Lehi Cano - Gears Always Turning

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  Hello world! I build digital tools and toys to help folks make their lives simpler and/or more enjoyable. I love picking at a problem or working towards a solution to break down large complex tasks into manageable bites/bytes to find an answer. The simplicity of the bicycle and a need for clean, concise functionality while having fun motivates me to work harder and progress my knowledge base.

## Some Stuff I've Built

Check it out here : https://rigs-n-routes.herokuapp.com/

## Site

A site for sharing bikepacking rigs/bikes and routes/trips. Users will be able to login or register, upload details on the build of their bike (things such as frame manufacturer, wheel size, drivetrain, bags used), and an option to add a trip they've taken on the bike.

## To-do / Future Updates

- Make file upload fully functional
- Allow multiple image uploads and organize in a gallery display (carousel maybe?)
- Connect Rides to Rigs to show which routes have been ridden on which bikes and vice/versa.
